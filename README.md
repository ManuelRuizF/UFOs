# UFOs
## Overview of Project  
We created a website that conatins UFO sightnings data. The website was modified and gived style through CSS.
The work that was asked to do for the challenge was to show a table organizing UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. We created an interactive table. The interaction was to be able to filter by multiple type of data creating. We created more filter bars to search in different type of data.  
Now you are able to filter through date, city, country, state, and the shape of the sightning.  
The table was created using JavaScript, while HTML/CSS and Bootstrap were used to modify the aesthetics of the website.
## Results   
The main page shows us the introduction to the UFO sightnings. Afterwards we can fin rhe table displaying all the data.

-The main pictures stretches too much. Better use another one that fits better.
